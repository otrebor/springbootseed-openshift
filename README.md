# springbootseed-openshift

this project is intended as a simple experiment to implement a REST api following some of the most popular practices to produce professional software.

## Base Idea ##

Create a seed that can be used to build and deploy Spring boot applications.

Objectives:

* the application has to be able to run locally
* the API has to generate documentation with swagger
* the application has to support different environments
* the application has to be deployed on minishift
* the application has to support a simple build pipeline on openshift
* the pipeline need to include code analysis using SonarQube
* the application has to match some quality measures in order to be deployed on minishift
